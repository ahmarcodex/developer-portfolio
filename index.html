            <p>i love travelling and exploring world natural beauty. Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most
                cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others. It
                teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it
                forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>

                you set off on this traditional dhoni cruise, you will be treated to lush green islands and pure white
                sand. Plunge beneath the surface of the ocean to discover underwater fauna, green turtle and manta ray,
                as well as shoals of colourful fish. You will also meet local inhabitants to learn about daily life in
