            <p>i love travelling and exploring world natural beauty. Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most
                cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others. It
                teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it
                forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>

                you set off on this traditional dhoni cruise, you will be treated to lush green islands and pure white
                sand. Plunge beneath the surface of the ocean to discover underwater fauna, green turtle and manta ray,
                as well as shoals of colourful fish. You will also meet local inhabitants to learn about daily life in
                the Maldives, and witness traditional Bodu Beru (Big Drum) performances</p>

                <p>As some of you may know, I have been in the design industry for the past 10 years working as a
                    freelance
                    designer in various companies while also running this blog. In fact, the majority of my income is
                    mostly
                    from my design freelance work over at The Pete Design.</p>
